  <p class="center">
    Agra is a historic city in Uttar Pradesh, India, best known for the
    world-famous Taj Mahal, one of the Seven Wonders of the World and a
    UNESCO World Heritage Site.
  </p>

  <p class="center">
    The Taj Mahal was built between 1632 and 1653 by the Mughal Emperor
    Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is considered
    one of the finest examples of Mughal architecture, combining elements
    of Islamic, Persian, and Indian styles.
  </p>

  <p class="center">
    Constructed entirely of white marble, the Taj Mahal is famous for its
    beautiful symmetry, intricate carvings, and precious stone inlay work.
    The monument changes color throughout the day, appearing pinkish in
    the morning, milky white in the evening, and golden under moonlight.
  </p>

  <p class="center">
    The Taj Mahal complex also includes a mosque, a guest house, lush
    gardens, and a long reflecting pool that enhances its beauty. The
    Yamuna River flows behind the monument, adding to its serene setting.
  </p>

  <p calss="center">
    Apart from the Taj Mahal, Agra is home to other major attractions such
    as Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage
    Sites. These monuments reflect the rich history and grandeur of the
    Mughal Empire.
  </p>

  <p class="center">
    The best time to visit the Taj Mahal is from October to March, when the
    weather is pleasant. The monument is closed on Fridays. Early morning
    visits are recommended to avoid crowds and enjoy the peaceful
    atmosphere.
