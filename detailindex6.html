  <h1>Red Fort</h1>

  <p>
    The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is one of the most important
    historical monuments in India, located in the heart of Delhi.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was built in 1648 by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and served as the
    main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years.
  </p>

  <p>
    Constructed using red sandstone, the fort is famous for its massive
    walls, intricate carvings, and impressive Mughal architecture.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Red Fort is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a symbol of India’s
    independence. Every year, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag
    here on Independence Day.
  </p>

  <p>
    Inside the fort, visitors can explore palaces, halls, and museums that
    showcase India’s rich history.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best time to visit the Red Fort is from October to March, and the
    evening light and sound show is a major attraction.
