  <h1>Golden Temple</h1>

  <p>
    The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, is the holiest shrine
    of Sikhism and is located in Amritsar, Punjab.
  </p>

  <p>
    Built by Guru Arjan Dev in the 16th century, the temple symbolizes
    equality, peace, and spirituality.
  </p>

  <p>
    The upper floors of the temple are covered with gold, giving it a
    stunning appearance, especially when reflected in the surrounding
    holy pool known as the Amrit Sarovar.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most remarkable features of the Golden Temple is the
    community kitchen, or Langar, which serves free meals to thousands of
    visitors every day, regardless of religion or background.
  </p>

  <p>
    The temple complex offers a peaceful and spiritual atmosphere,
    attracting devotees and tourists from all over the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    The best time to visit the Golden Temple is between October and March,
    when the weather is comfortable.
